Hi {{ user.username }},

Someone asked me to write a script that would allow them to automate the process of creating a new user in their {{ email }}.

If this was a new user, it would send a welcome email with a link to set your password:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you forgot your password: {{ user.username }}, you can reset it using the same link.
